    <p>The adjusted family income is the amount used, in part, to determine eligibility for the CLB and the amount of the CESG. Adjusted family income is the primary caregiver's, and their spouse/common-law partner's pre-taxed income (line 23600 of the income tax return), minus any Canada Child Benefit (CCB) and Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) income received. If you repaid any CCB or RDSP income in a given year, you can add that amount is added back into your adjusted family income.</p>
