<p>Funding pages focus on helping people complete tasks associated with applying for funding for a specific program. This is an Employment and Social Development (ESDC) specific template created for contribution grants and funding pages based on user research and testing with users. </p>
<p> These pages help people:</p>
<ul>
	<li>determine eligibility for funding program</li>
	<li>learn what information is needed to complete the application</li>
	<li>learn how to submit the application</li>
	<li>learn what happens after the application is submitted</li>
	<li>find resources and contact information for help</li>
</ul>
<ul class="list-unstyled">

			<summary>Benefits of this template</summary>
			<p>While there are many ways this information can be presented, this template should be used for all contributions funding programs.</p>
			<p>This template:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>supports a consistent approach to task initiation and completion, including ordering by steps</li>
				<li>provides people with the information they need before initiating the task</li>
				<li>offers alternate methods to apply (for example: online, in-person or by mail)</li>
				<li>ensures that experienced clients can quickly initiate a task and choose whether to review the supporting information offered</li>
				<li>breaks up long and complex content into pages that each focus on a step or specific answer people need before moving to the next step or section.</li>

	<ul class="fa-ul">
		<li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span><strong>Don't use numbers when you use this pattern for sequenced steps.</strong> Testing has shown that Canadians are less likely to get to the section they need if the elements are numbered.</li>

	<h2 id="h2.03">How to implement</h2>
	<p>The purpose of this template is to provide a common structure to the Funding Page, including the Application Instructions, written for Contribution programs under Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) in order to standardize language across programs. The Grants and Contribution Funding Page Template is used to help applicants apply for funding under the:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a rel="alternate" href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=EMP5523">Standard Contribution Application Form </a>(EMP5523) or</li>
		<li><a rel="alternate" href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=EMP5671">Standard Grant Application for Funding</a> (EMP5671)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This template also applies to programs that have specific forms for their application for funding.</p>
	<p>Should your guide differ from this template, ADM approval is required.</p>

						<h6>FAQ (optional)</h6>
						<p>The FAQ section is optional. Ideally, we hope that the information is organized and written clearly so that people can find the answers to their questions within the content. However, when an application period is open, that is not the time to re-write and re-design content. To help users during this period, we can add this FAQ section. Add a link to the section of the CFP that addresses the question. This avoids duplicating content. </p>

		<p>As a federal institution, ESDC is subject to the <a rel="external" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/index.html">Official Languages Act (OLA)</a>.</p>
		<details>
			<summary><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> Official Languages laws and regulations</summary>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/official_languages/topics/comm-serv-pub.shtml">Communications with and Services to the Public | Part IV:</a> Information about the language employees use when serving citizens, languages to be used in communications to the public, services of equal quality, active offers of service, etc.</li>
				<li><a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/official_languages/topics/lang_work_equit_part_staff.shtml">Language of Work, Equitable Participation and Staffing Generally | Part V, VI and Section 91:</a> Information about language rights at work as a federal government employee, official language obligations as a manager, equal opportunities for employment and advancement for English and French speaking Canadians, determination of language requirements of positions, etc. </li>
				<li><a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/official_languages/topics/advancement_eng_fren.shtml">Advancement of English and French | Part VII:</a> Information about official language minority communities, programs and policies that meet the needs of these communities, fostering the full recognition and use of both official languages, etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Under the OLA, every department has the duty to take positive measures to implement Canada’s commitment to enhancing the vitality of Official Languages (OL). An example of positive measure is to make official language minority communities (OLMCs) a priority for an intake process. Please refer to the <a href="http://esdc.prv/en/sspb/officiallanguageslens.shtml">Official Languages LENS</a> to learn more.</p>
			<p>ESDC must inform applicants in advance if it intends to prioritize projects national in scope catering to both OL. This will allow them to develop their application accordingly. Also, ESDC must indicate if the intent is to only fund projects national in scope that are bilingual. The documents must identify this as a requirement to inform applicants before they apply.</p>
			<p>It is not mandatory for all projects national in scope to offer bilingual services. The program's Terms and Conditions (Ts&Cs) would need to specify this eligibility criteria (Treasury Board (TB) Submission stage). However, the program may set requirements to ensure services and programs are available to both OL communities. Please refer to the <a href="http://esdc.prv/en/service-canada/pob/coegc/pddpf.shtml">Program Design and Delivery Planning Framework</a>. It offers OL considerations for the Memorandum to Cabinet and TB Submission stages.</p>
