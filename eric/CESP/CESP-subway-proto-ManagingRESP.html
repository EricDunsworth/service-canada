<h2 id="_howlong">How long RESPs can stay open</h2>
<p>You can make contributions into an RESP until 31 years after you first opened it. You would then have until the end of the 35th year after the plan was first opened to use the funds before the RESP expires (or up to 40 years for a specified plan).</p>
<p>If the beneficiary (the child you're saving for) chooses not to continue their education right after high school, the RESP can stay open in the case that they change their mind later. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="_addbens">Adding or changing beneficiaries</h2>
<details>
<summary>Adding another child to an RESP family plan</summary>
    <p>To add another child to an existing RESP family plan, the child must be related to you by blood or adoption, and they must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>be under 21 years old at the time you add them to the plan; or</li>
      <li>have been a beneficiary of another family RESP immediately before being added to this one.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As with any RESP, you must provide the new beneficiary’s SIN to the RESP provider.</p>
    <p>If the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/education-savings/savings-grant.html">Canada Education Savings Grant</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/learning-bond.html">Canada Learning Bond</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/support/scholarships/bc-training-and-education-savings-grant">British Columbia Training and Education Savings Grant (<abbr>BCTESG</abbr>)</a> has already been paid into the RESP, you can add a brother or sister of the existing beneficiary to the plan without penalty. </p>
    <p>While the <a rel="external" href="http://www.saskatchewan.ca/SAGES">Saskatchewan Advantage Grant for Education Savings (SAGES)</a> can only be paid into a sibling-only plan, a cousin can be added to the plan without having to repay the SAGES already in the RESP.</p>
    <p>If you add a beneficiary who is not a sibling of the beneficiaries already named on the plan, you will need to repay the grants or bonds to the Government of Canada.</p>
  </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Naming a replacement beneficiary</summary>
      <p>You may change the beneficiary named on an individual, family or group RESP.</p>
      <p>Ask your provider how your contributions will be affected if you switch beneficiaries. (Before opening an RESP, check with your provider to find out about the terms and conditions of the plan.)</p>
      <p>As with opening any RESP, the new beneficiary’s Social Insurance Number (SIN) must be provided.</p>
      <p>There are special rules to consider when changing the beneficiary. When the beneficiary changes, the contributions made for the former beneficiary are now intended for the new beneficiary. If the new beneficiary already has an RESP, this may create an <a href="http://test.canada.ca/service-canada/eric/CESP/CESP-subway-proto-contributions.html#_Over">excess contribution</a>. There are two exceptions:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>if the new beneficiary is under 21 years of age, and both the new and the former beneficiary have the same parent</li>
        <li>if both beneficiaries are under 21 years of age, and are connected by a blood relationship or adoption to the original subscriber of the RESP </li>
	  </ul>
   </details>
      <details>
    <summary>If a child is named as a beneficiary in more than one plan</summary>
<p>Grant payments happen on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to annual Grant and lifetime Grant limits.</p>

<p>For example, if two subscribers make contributions in the same month to two separate RESPs, the RESP with the subscriber's contribution dated earliest in the month will get the Grant. If the contributions are made on the same day, the Grant will be pro-rated (split proportionately).</p>

<p>It is important for subscribers to let each other know about their contributions. This will maximize the yearly CESG room, while respecting the lifetime contribution limit of $50,000.</p>

    <details>
    <summary>If the RESP is used for education</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Your money grows tax-free while it is in your RESP.</li>
      <li>You do not get a tax deduction for the money you put into an RESP.</li>
      <li>The money that your investment earns while it is in the RESP will not be taxed until money is taken out to pay for your child's education.</li>
      <li>Money paid out of the RESP as an Educational Assistance Payment (EAP) is taxed in the hands of the student. Since many students have little or no other income, they can usually withdraw the money tax-free.</li>
      <li>The money that you have put in the RESP is returned to you, tax-free.</li>
    </ul>

  </details>		 
    <details>
    <summary>If the RESP is not used for education</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>You will not be taxed on the amount you contributed to the RESP, but you will have to pay taxes on the money that you earned in your plan as interest. This money is called "accumulated income". It will be taxed at your regular income tax level, plus an additional 20%.</li>
      <li>The money that you have put into the RESP is returned to you.</li>
      <li>The Grant can be shared with a sibling if they have grant room available—otherwise, the Grant must be returned to the Government of Canada.</li>
      <li>Talk to your RESP provider to find out about any conditions that may apply to the plan if your child does not continue his or her education after high school.</li>

  <h2 id="_closing">Closing the RESP</h2>
	  <p>When you close your RESP, you will have to pay tax on the earnings in the RESP. The Grant must be returned to the Government of Canada.</p>
	  <p>You may be able to reduce the taxes you have to pay by transferring your AIP to either you or your spouse's Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). </p>
		<p>Any <strong>savings</strong> that remain in your RESP when it closes will be handled as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>money received from either <a href="http://test.canada.ca/service-canada/eric/CESP/CESP-subway-proto-aboutplan.html#_Grants_and_bonds">the Grant</a> or <a href="http://test.canada.ca/service-canada/eric/CESP/CESP-subway-proto-aboutplan.html#_Grants_and_bonds">the Bond</a> will be returned to the Government of Canada; and</li>
			<li>any personal savings in the account will be returned to the person who opened the plan.</li>
		</ul>

	<p>The <strong>accumulated interest</strong> earned on both the personal savings as well as the Bond or any government grants can be:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>paid to the subscriber and taxed (<a href="#AIP">AIP</a>)
      <ul>
        <li>note: you do not need to close a plan to receive an AIP</li>
      </ul>

    <li>transferred to an <a href="#_transfers">RESP</a> of the subscriber or the subscriber’s spouse</li>
    <li>transferred to a child’s <a href="#_transfers">RESP</a></li>
    <li>gifted to a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/post-secondary/designated-schools.html">designated educational institution</a>
    </li>
    </ul><p>Ask your RESP provider for more details and for explanations on any conditions or penalties that may apply to your RESP should you decide to close the account.</p>
