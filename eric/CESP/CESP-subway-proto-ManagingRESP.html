<section>
<h2 id="_howlong">How long RESPs can stay open</h2>
<p>You can make contributions into a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) until 31 years after you first opened it. You would then have until the end of the 35th year after the plan was first opened to use the funds before the RESP expires (or up to 40 years for a specified plan).</p>
<p>If the beneficiary chooses not to continue their education right after high school, the RESP can stay open in the case that they change their mind later. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="_contrib">Contributing to the RESP</h2>
<p>Some types of RESP require specific monthly contributions. Other types let you put money into the RESP whenever you want. Check with your RESP promoter before or after you open an RESP.<strong> No contributions to the RESP are needed to get the Canada Learning Bond (CLB)</strong>).</p>
<p>There is no annual limit to how much you can contribute to the RESP. Over the lifetime of the RESP, the maximum that can be contributed is $50,000.</p>
	<details>
<summary>Over-contributions</summary>
    <p>An over-contribution occurs when the total contributions made to a beneficiary in one or more RESP(s) exceed the lifetime limit of $50,000.</p>
    <p>When an  over-contribution occurs, you will be required to pay tax in the amount of one percent per month on your share of the over-contribution until it is withdrawn.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
<summary id="withdraw">Withdrawing contributions</summary>
    <p>Under normal circumstances, a withdrawal of contributions will require a repayment of the CESG, except when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you withdraw contributions to eliminate an over-contribution; and</li>
      <li>the total over-contribution is not more than $4,000 at the time of withdrawal; or</li>
      <li>the RESP beneficiary is eligible for an Educational Assistance Payment (EAP).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the total over-contribution is more than $4,000 at the time of withdrawal, the CESG is repayable on the entire amount withdrawn. If this happens, the grant room is not restored by the repaid amount of the CESG.   		</p>
<p>For more information on over-contributions as well as tax penalties, consult the <a rel="external" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-education-savings-plans-resps/resp-contributions.html">CRA.</a></p>
	</details>
</section>
  <section>
      <h3 id="_Tracking">Tracking RESP contributions </h3>
      <p>It's important to track how much you contribute to the RESP, especially if you have more than one. Make sure you don't over-contribute. You should also <a href="./CESP-subway-proto-usingRESP.html#_trackgrant"> track how much CESG you receive</a> to make sure you don't go over the CESG lifetime limit.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Family plan contributions</summary>
        <p>If you have a family plan with two or more children, contributions must be tracked for each child named in the plan. You can make more than one contribution at a time, and the amounts do not have to be the same for each child.</p>
    </details>
<details>
  <summary>Group plan contributions</summary>
        <p>When you open a group plan, you agree to make contributions into the group RESP at set times for the duration of the RESP contract.</p>
        <p>The RESP promoter will credit the money you put into the group RESP to an account in your name. Any government Bond or grants received by the beneficiary will be put into a separate account that is in the beneficiary’s name.</p>
        <p>The interest earned on your savings can be shared within the group plan; however, the interest earned on government grants or bonds cannot be shared and goes directly to the beneficiary named in the RESP.</p>
    </details>
      </section>

<section>
<h2 id="_addbens">Adding or changing beneficiaries</h2>
<details>
<summary>Adding another child to an RESP family plan</summary>
    <p>To add another child to an existing RESP family plan, the child must be related to you by blood or adoption, and they must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>be under 21 years old at the time you add them to the plan; or</li>
      <li>have been a beneficiary of another family RESP immediately before being added to this one.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As with any RESP, you must provide the new beneficiary’s Social Insurance Number (SIN) to the RESP provider.</p>
    <p>If the CESG, the CLB, or <a rel="external" href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/support/scholarships/bc-training-and-education-savings-grant">British Columbia Training and Education Savings Grant (<abbr>BCTESG</abbr>)</a> has already been paid into the RESP, you can add a sibling of the existing beneficiary to the RESP without penalty. </p>
    <p>While the <a rel="external" href="http://www.saskatchewan.ca/SAGES">Saskatchewan Advantage Grant for Education Savings (SAGES)</a> can only be paid into a sibling-only RESP, a cousin can be added to the RESP without having to repay the SAGES already in the RESP.</p>
    <p>If you add a beneficiary who is not a sibling of the beneficiaries already named on the plan, you will need to repay the grants or bonds to the Government of Canada.</p>
  </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Naming a replacement beneficiary</summary>
      <p>You may change the beneficiary named on an individual, family or group RESP.</p>
      <p>Ask your promoter how your contributions will be affected if you switch beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>As with opening any RESP, the new beneficiary’s Social Insurance Number (SIN) must be provided.</p>
      <p>There are special rules to consider when changing the beneficiary. When the beneficiary changes, the contributions made for the former beneficiary are now intended for the new beneficiary. If the new beneficiary already has an RESP, this may create an <a href="http://test.canada.ca/service-canada/eric/CESP/CESP-subway-proto-contributions.html#_Over">over-contribution</a>. There are two exceptions:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>if the new beneficiary is under 21 years of age, and both the new and the former beneficiary have the same parent</li>
        <li>if both beneficiaries are under 21 years of age, and are connected by a blood relationship or adoption to the original subscriber of the RESP </li>
	  </ul>
   </details>
		   </section>
			 <section>
         <h2 id="_number">Beneficiaries named on more than one RESP </h2>
           		<p>You can be named as the beneficiary or subscriber on more than one RESP. There is no limit on the number of RESPs from different institutions one individual can have in their name, but there is a lifetime RESP contribution limit of $50,000 per beneficiary. This limit includes all contributions made in all RESPs combined. It is important for subscribers to let each other know about their contributions. This will maximize the yearly CESG room, while respecting the lifetime contribution limit of $50,000.</p>
<details>
              <summary> The CESG gets paid to the RESP with the earliest contribution</summary>
           		<p>CESG payments are made to a single plan on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to annual CESG and lifetime CESG limits. If you have two RESPs with the same beneficiary, the CESG may only get added to one of the RESPs.</p>
              <p> For example: If you contribute $2,500 (the maximum amount for the CESG calculation) through one RESP promoter on January 15, and later put in a subsequent $2,500 through a different promoter on February 15, the CESG will only be deposited into the first plan you contributed to. When contributions are made on the same date the amounts are split in half between two plans, each plan receives one half of the CESG.</p>
           		<p>If you contribute through monthly instalments, the CESG is paid into each plan until either the maximum that can be paid in a year, or the lifetime contribution limit, is reached.</p>

  <h2 id="_closing">Closing the RESP</h2>
	  <p>When you close your RESP, you will have to pay tax on the earnings in the RESP. Federal benefits (the CLB and CESG) must be returned to the Government of Canada, and any provincial benefits must be returned to the provincial government.</p>
		<p>Any savings that remain in your RESP when it closes will be handled as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>money received from either benefits will be returned to the Government of Canada; and</li>
			<li>any personal contributions to the account will be returned to the person who opened the RESP.</li>
		</ul>

	<p>The accumulated interest earned on benefits can be:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>paid to the subscriber and taxed (AIP)
      <ul>
        <li>note: you do not need to close an RESP to receive an AIP</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>transferred to an RESP of the subscriber or the subscriber’s spouse</li>
    <li>transferred to a child’s RESP</li>
    <li>gifted to a designated educational institution</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ask your RESP promoter for more details and for explanations on any conditions or penalties that may apply to your RESP should you decide to close it.</p>
