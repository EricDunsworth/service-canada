<h2 id="_Bond">CLB amounts and eligibility</h2>
<p>If the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" title="beneficiary definition" href="#inline_content_modal_bens">beneficiary</a> is eligible to receive the Canada Learning Bond (CLB), they could receive <strong>$500 the first year</strong>, then another <strong>$100 every year they're eligible </strong> after that, up to a lifetime maximum of $2,000.</p> Adults between the ages of 18 and 20 years old may still be eligible to receive the CLB - consult the criteria below.

<h3>CLB eligibility </h3>
<p>No contributions to the RESP are needed to get the CLB. Eligibility for the CLB is based on the number of children in the family, and the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" title="adjusted family income definition" href="#inline_content_modal_income">adjusted family income</a> of the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" title="primary caregiver definition" href="#inline_content_modal_bens">primary caregiver.</a></p>

  <p>The CLB amounts accumulate each year until December 31 of the year in which the beneficiary turns 15. The primary caregiver can request the CLB on behalf of the child until they turn 18. At that point, the adult beneficiary can request the CLB for themselves until the day before they turn 21 years of age. </p>

<p>To be eligible for the CLB, the beneficiary must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>be a resident of Canada</li>
  <li>have a Social Insurance Number (SIN)</li>
  <li>be named as a beneficiary in an RESP</li>
  <li>be born on or after January 1, 2004</li>
  <li>be from a family with low-income</li>
</ul>

<p>As well, to be eligible for the CLB, the primary caregiver of the beneficiary must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>file income tax returns for each year they wish to request the CLB for the beneficiary </li>
  <li>be eligible to receive the Canada Child Benefit (CCB)</li>
</ul>


  <p> For July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, the income eligibility amount for the CLB is based on the following:</p>

<summary>Adjusted family income definition</summary>
<p>The adjusted family income is the amount used, in part, to determine eligibility for the CLB and the amount of the CESG.</p>
<p>Adjusted family income is the primary caregiver's, and their spouse/common-law partner's <strong> pre-taxed income </strong> (line 23600 of the income tax return), minus any Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) and Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) income received. </p>
<p>If you repaid any UCCB or RDSP income in a given year, you can add that amount back into your adjusted family income. </p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Primary caregiver definition</summary>
<p>This is the person who is eligible to receive the Canada Child Benefit in the child's name. The signature and Social Insurance Number of the primary caregiver or, as of January 2018, of their cohabiting spouse or common-law partner , are required when requesting certain benefits</p>

<h2 id="_Grant">CESG amounts and eligibility</h2>
<p>The CESG can add a maximum of $500 to an RESP each year, and children from families with middle- or low-income may be eligible to get up to $100 more each year. Contributions must be made to the RESP to receive the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG). </p>
<p>The CESG provides a percentage of the contributions made to the RESP, up to 20% of the first $2500 contributed. As well, families with middle- and low-income can receive an additional percentage of the first $500 they contribute. You do not need to contribute the maximum amount to receive the CESG - any eligible contribution made within the limit will receive some amount of the CESG.</p>
<p>CESG amounts accumulate and can carry-forward to the current year. If you don’t receive the maximum CESG amount in a given year, you can still receive it in future years. You can catch up on this amount by making more contributions to the RESP. The lifetime maximum amount of the CESG a child can get is $7,200.</p>

<h3>CESG amounts depend on the beneficiary's family income</h3>

  <p>The adjusted family income is the amount used, in part, to determine eligibility for the CLB and the amount of the CESG.</p>

  <p>If you repaid any UCCB or RDSP income in a given year, you can add that amount back into your adjusted family income. </p>
  </details>

<h3>CESG eligibility</h3>
<p>The CESG is available until the end of the calendar year that a child turns 17. However, there are eligibility restrictions for children who are 16 or 17 years old. <strong>A contribution must be made to the RESP to receive the CESG.</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for the CESG, the child must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>be a resident of Canada</li>
  <li>have a Social Insurance Number (SIN)</li>
  <li>be named as a beneficiary in an RESP</li>
  <li>be 17 years old or younger</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the <strong>calendar year</strong> to determine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CESG eligibility</li>
  <li>the amount of contributions made </li>
  <li>the CESG room earned and used in the last year </li>
</ul>
<details>
  <summary>CESG eligibility for children aged 16 or 17 </summary>
  <p>Children who are 16 or 17 years old may be eligible to get the CESG. To be eligible, they must meet at least one of the following conditions before the end of the calendar year they turn 15:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>at least $2,000 is contributed to (and not withdrawn from) the RESP</li>
    <li>a minimum annual contribution of $100 is made to (and not withdrawn from) the RESP in any four previous years</li>
  </ul>
</details>
		<details>
		<summary id="carry-forward">CESG carry forward</summary>
<p>Unused CESG amounts from previous years accumulate until the end of the year in which the child turns 17, even if they are not a beneficiary of an RESP.</p>
<p>If there is an unused CESG amount from previous years, the subscriber can contribute more than $2,500 to the RESP per year and receive up to 20% of their contributions (up to $5,000) each year. This way, a child could get up to $1,000 of the CESG in their RESP per calendar year if there are unused amounts from previous years.</p>
<p>As long as the lifetime CESG limit ($7,200) is not exceeded, the CESG room can be carried forward.</p>
