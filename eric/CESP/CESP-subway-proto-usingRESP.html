             <h2 id="withdrawals">Taking money out of an RESP</h2>
             <p>Money in an RESP can come from many sources:</p>
             <ul>
               <li><strong>contributions</strong> from the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" title="subscriber definition" href="#inline_content_modal_sub">subscriber</a> and/or others</li>
               <li><strong>benefits</strong> received, like the Canada Learning Bond (CLB), Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG), and/or provincial benefits</li>
               <li><strong>interest accumulated</strong> on the money in the RESP</li>
             </ul>
             <br>
             <p>Because of these different sources of money in an RESP, there are different ways to withdraw.</p>
               <p><strong>Educational Assistance Payments (EAPs)</strong> include money from benefits and accumulated interest. EAPs are considered income for the  <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" title="beneficiary definition" href="#inline_content_modal_bens">beneficiary</a> and are taxed when taken from the RESP. However, beneficiaries may not have much income during their studies, so it is possible that the beneficiary pays little to no tax when receiving an EAP. </p>
               <p><strong>A withdrawal of contributions</strong> can be requested by the RESP subscriber. The contributions can be taken out of the RESP tax-free, and paid to either the subscriber or the beneficiary. For example, a subscriber could request a withdrawal of contributions  if they have no longer any benefits in their RESP. </p>
               <p>If interest in the RESP is not used by the beneficiary through an EAP, accumulated interest can be paid out on its own. This is called an <strong>Accumulated Income Payment (AIP)</strong>, and is usually paid to the subscriber. It is taxed at the regular income tax rate of the subscriber, plus an additional 20% (or 12% for subscribers residing in Quebec).</p>
               <p>For more information about taking money out of an RESP, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-education-savings-plans-resps/payments-resp.html">consult the Canada Revenue Agency.</a></p>


<section>
  <h2 id="_howto">How to use the RESP to pay for education</h2>
<p>You can use the money in the RESP to pay for education right away, or keep it for future education. To take money out of the RESP to pay for education, the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" title="subscriber definition" href="#inline_content_modal_sub">subscriber</a> asks the RESP <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" title="promoter definition" href="#inline_content_modal_prom">promoter</a> for an EAP. The <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" title="beneficiary definition" href="#inline_content_modal_bens">beneficiary</a> can use the EAP money to pay for expenses like tuition, books, tools, transportation, and rent. </p>

<p>To receive an EAP and pay for education:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the beneficiary must enrol in full- or part-time studies at an <a href="#_eligible">eligible school</a> (in Canada or abroad). Programs must meet the <a href="#_minimum">minimum weeks of study and hours per week</a> to be eligible </li>
	<li>the subscriber must request the EAP from the RESP promoter</li>
	<li>the beneficiary must provide the RESP promoter with <a href="#_docu">proof of enrolment</a></li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="_eligible">1. See if the school is eligible</h2>
    		<p>It is the responsibility of the RESP promoter to check if a school is eligible before giving the beneficiary money to pay for school. The school must be one of the following:</p>
        <details>
          <summary>Canadian universities, colleges or other educational institutions</summary>
          Check the following lists to see if the education institution is eligible:
          <ul>
            <li>Universities and colleges: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/designated-schools.html">List of Designated Educational Institutions</a>;</li>
            <li>Other educational institutions and professional schools: <a href="http://certification.esdc.gc.ca/lea-mcl/h.4m.2@-eng.jsp;jsessionid=yyY2J2SDMrJcWN1P44dCsVTQQcS8ptqxXzkRQBLrRZKNv92wt2y6!-2132938879">List of Certified Institutions</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you can't find your school on this list, you may still be eligible to receive an EAP, if the school has been designated by a provincial authority under the <em>Canada Student Loans Act</em>. Your student financial assistance office can provide more information. For the contact information for the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/education/province-territory-student-financial-assistance.html">student financial assistance office in your province/territory</a> or call Service Canada at 1 800 O-Canada (1-800-622-6232).</p>
        </details>
</section>
   <section>
     <details>
       <summary>Outside of Canada: Universities, colleges, or other educational institutions</summary>
       <p>For the purposes of EAP, eligible educational institutions outside of Canada do not have to be on the List of Designated Educational Institutions. For an EAP to be paid out, the beneficiary must have been enrolled in a course with a duration of not less than 13 consecutive weeks (3 weeks for university programs).</p>
</details>
    	</section>
      <section>
      		<h3 id="_minimum">Minimum program length</h3>
          <p>To be eligible for an EAP, the education program must last a certain number of weeks, and include a certain number of hours per week.</p>
          <details>
            <summary>Full-time program in Canada</summary>
			  <p>A course or program that lasts at least three weeks in a row, with at least 10 hours of instruction or work per week.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Full-time program outside Canada</summary>
            <p>A program at a foreign educational institution with a duration of at least 13 weeks, or 3 weeks for university programs.</p>

          <details>
            <summary>Part-time program in Canada</summary>
            <p>An educational program at post-secondary school level that lasts at least three consecutive weeks, and that requires a student to spend not less than 12 hours per month on courses in the program.</p>

            			<p>To withdraw money from the RESP, the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" title="subscriber definition" href="#inline_content_modal_sub">subscriber</a> should contact their RESP <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" title="promoter definition" href="#inline_content_modal_prom">promoter.</a></p>
                <p>Once the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" title="beneficiary definition" href="#inline_content_modal_bens">beneficiary</a> has enrolled full-time or part-time in a qualifying post-secondary educational program, the subscriber can request an EAP to withdraw money from the RESP to help pay for the beneficiary's studies. </p>
			             <p>EAPs include the interest earned in the RESP as well as benefits received. EAPs are considered taxable income for the beneficiary.</p>

                  <p>The RESP promoter will ask to see <strong>official proof of enrollment</strong> before giving the beneficiary the EAP. They may also provide a list of allowable expenses that the money can be used for, or they <strong>may ask for receipts</strong> for school purchases to prove the money is being spent on allowable educational expenses.</p>
            			<p>Because they are responsible for administering the RESP in accordance with the <em>Income Tax Act</em>, your RESP promoter determines what is considered a reasonable expense. Any expense that is in accordance with the Act and the terms of the plan would be considered reasonable.</p>
