<p>You can use the money in your registered education savings plan (RESP) to pay for your education expenses right away, or leave your RESP open to help pay for your future education. </p>

<p>When you decide to withdraw money from your RESP, contact your RESP promoter to request an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-education-savings-plans-resps/payments-resp/educational-assistance-payments-eaps.html"><strong>educational assistance payment</strong></a>.</p>

<p>To receive an educational assistance payment, you must:</p>
<ul>
	<li>enrol in full- or part-time studies at an <a href="#_eligible">eligible school</a> (in Canada or abroad) that takes place over a period of at least 3 weeks in a row</a></li>
	<li>provide your RESP promoter with <a href="#_withdraw">proof of enrolment</a></li>
	</ul>

<p>Use your educational assistance payments to help pay for expenses like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>tuition</li>
	<li>books</li>
	<li>tools</li>
	<li>transportation</li>
	<li>rent</li></ul>
<p>Your RESP promoter can provide more information on the type of eligible expenses and the process for requesting an educational assistance payment.</p></section>

    		<p>For the purposes of an Educational Assistance Payment, a post-secondary educational institution can be any one of the following:</p>
    		<ul>
    			<li>a university, college or other educational institution in Canada that is designated under the <em>Canada Student Financial Assistance Act</em>.

    			<li>a university, college or other educational institution in Canada that has been designated by a provincial authority under the <em>Canada Student Loans Act</em>. Your student financial assistance office can provide more information. For the contact information for the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/education/province-territory-student-financial-assistance.html">student financial assistance office in your province/territory</a> or call Service Canada at 1 800 O-Canada (1-800-622-6232).</li>

For the purposes of Educational Assistance Payments, eligible educational institutions outside of Canada do not have to be on the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/programs/designated-schools.html">List of Designated Educational Institutions</a>. For an Educational Assistance Payment to be paid out, the beneficiary must have been enrolled in a course with a duration of not less than 13 consecutive weeks (3 weeks for university programs).</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>The post-secondary educational institution must satisfy only one of the criteria above to be eligible for Educational Assistance Payment purposes. It is the RESP provider’s responsibility to examine all relevant authorities to verify if an educational institution is recognized.</p>
    	</section>
      <section>
      		<h3>Minimum duration of a qualifying educational program</h3>
      		<p><strong>Full-time program in Canada:</strong> A course of study that lasts at least three weeks in a row, with at least 10 hours of instruction or work per week. </p>

            		<section>
            			<h3>Request an Educational Assistance Payment on behalf of the student</h3>
            			<p>Once the child (the Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) beneficiary) has graduated from high school and enrolled full-time or part-time in a <a href="#h3">qualifying post-secondary educational program,</a> you can request, on his or her behalf, to withdraw money from the RESP to help pay for their studies.</p>
            			<p>When you withdraw government payments or interest earned from an RESP account, that money is called an Educational Assistance Payment.</p>
            			<p>Educational Assistance Payments include the interest earned in the RESP as well as any <a href="/en/services/benefits/education/education-savings/savings-grant.html">Canada Education Savings Grants</a>, <a href="/en/services/benefits/education/education-savings/provincial.html">provincial grants</a> and <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/learning-bond.html">Canada Learning Bonds</a> received. You can use this money to pay for post-secondary school expenses like tuition, books and transportation.</p>
            		</section>
            		<section>
            			<h3>Provide required documentation to support your request</h3>
            			<p>To withdraw money from an RESP, contact your <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/student-financial-aid/education-savings/resp/choose-provider.html">RESP provider</a>. They will ask to see official proof of enrollment before issuing the Educational Assistance Payment. They may also provide you with a list of allowable expenses that the money can be used for, or they may ask for receipts for school purchases to prove the money is being spent on allowable educational expenses.</p>
            			<p>Because they are responsible for administering the RESP in accordance with the <em>Income Tax Act</em>, your RESP provider determines what is considered a “reasonable” expense (i.e. one that can be paid for with the savings). Any expense that is in accordance with the Act and the terms of the plan would be considered reasonable.</p>
            			<p>One way to decide if a school expense is reasonable is to ask yourself whether or not this purchase will serve to further the student’s studies.</p>
            			<div class="well well-sm">
            				<p><strong>Note: </strong>Your RESP provider may have established  guidelines or policies with respect to acceptable educational expenditures.

              		<p>If the beneficiary is enrolled in full-time post-secondary studies, Educational Assistance Payments are limited to $5,000 during the first 13 consecutive weeks of enrollment. </p>
              		<p>After that, you may request any available amount with no limit unless the student takes a break from his or her studies and does not re-enroll in a qualifying educational program for 12 months. If that happens, the original limit is reinstated.</p>
              		<p>If the beneficiary is enrolled in part-time studies, Educational Assistance Payments are limited to $2,500 for every 13-week period of enrollment. </p>
              		<p>For both full- and part-time studies, the student is also eligible to receive payments for up to six months after the end of his or her enrollment in a qualifying program (provided the provisions of your plan allow this benefit). This is only possible if the expenses would have qualified for Educational Assistance Payments if they had been paid immediately before the student’s enrollment stopped.</p>

              			<h4>Special circumstances</h4>
              			<p>If you need to withdraw more money than the limits allow for full- or part-time studies, your RESP provider can submit a request to the Minister of Employment and Social Development for approval. If the request is approved, the provider must then complete a request form on your behalf and submit it to the Canada Education Savings Program.</p>

              			<h4>Canada Education Savings Grant lifetime limit</h4>
              			<p>Educational Assistance Payments consist of earnings as well as the <a href="/en/services/benefits/education/education-savings/savings-grant.html">Canada Education Savings Grants</a>, <a href="/en/services/benefits/education/education-savings/provincial.html">provincial grants</a> and <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/learning-bond.html">Canada Learning Bonds</a> received. The beneficiary cannot receive more than $7,200 in Canada Education Savings Grants in his or her lifetime.</p>
              			<p>When a student receives an Educational Assistance Payment, he or she will also receive a notice detailing the amount of Canada Education Savings Grants in the payment received. It is the student’s responsibility to keep track of the amount of Canada Education Savings Grant money received; beneficiaries must repay any amount over the $7,200 limit.</p>

                             <li>the beneficiary of the RESP has a severe and prolonged mental impairment that can reasonably be expected to prevent the beneficiary from pursuing post-secondary education; or</li>

                           <p>The following RDSP requirements must also be met at the time the rollover is made:</p>

                             <li>the beneficiary is eligible for the Disability Tax Credit; </li>

                             <li>the beneficiary is a resident of Canada; </li>
                             <li>the rollover amount cannot cause the RDSP to exceed the lifetime contribution limit of $200,000; and</li>

                           <p>When RESP investment earnings are rolled over to an RDSP, the RESP must be closed before March of the year following the year of the rollover. In addition, the remaining Canada Education Savings Grant, Canada Learning Bond and provincial incentives must be repaid. Contributions in the RESP will be returned to the RESP subscriber.</p>
