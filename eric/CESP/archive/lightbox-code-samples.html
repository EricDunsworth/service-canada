<p>The <strong>subscriber</strong> is the person who opens the RESP with a promoter. The <strong>promoter</strong> is usually a financial institution. The <strong> beneficiary </strong> is the person who will get money from the RESP to pay for their education after high school â€” usually a child. Once a subscriber opens an RESP, they can apply for benefits and consider making contributions to their RESP. The money in the RESP helps to pay the costs of the beneficiary's full- or part-time studies after high school.</p>
