               <h2 id="_Types_of_payments">Types of withdrawals from your plan</h2>
               <p>You can request that withdrawals be made from your plan at any time, if your financial organization allows single payments. If you make a withdrawal and have received grant or bond within the last 10 years, you will have to repay some or all of that grant and bond. Recurring payments must begin by the end of the calendar year that the beneficiary turns 60 and must continue at least annually until no funds remain or the beneficiary dies.  
               <p>You <strong>must</strong> contact your financial organization to determine how much you can withdraw and to start receiving payments. </p>
               <h3>There are two types of payments </h3>
               <details>
                  <summary><h4>Recurring payments</h4></summary>
                  <p>A lifetime disability assistance payment (<abbr title="Lifetime Disability Assistance Payment">LDAP</abbr>) is a<strong> recurring</strong> payment paid directly to the beneficiary. </p>
                  <p><abbr title="Lifetime Disability Assistance Payment">LDAP</abbr> payments <strong>must begin</strong> by the end of the calendar year that the <strong>beneficiary turns 60</strong>.</p>
                  <p>If you would like to begin <abbr title="Lifetime Disability Assistance Payment">LDAP</abbr> payments, please contact your financial organization. You may make this request with your financial organization before you turn 60. You will have to repay a portion of the grants and bonds if they were deposited in your plan less than 10 years ago.</p>
                  <p>If you don’t contact your financial organization, they will contact you to let you know that payments must begin. </p>
                  <p>Once your payments begin, the beneficiary will continue to receive them until either:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>the beneficiary dies, or</li>
                     <li>the money in the plan runs out </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>When one of these situations occurs, <a href="http://test.canada.ca/service-canada/CDSP/CDSP-subway-proto-transferclose.html#_Plan_closure">the plan is closed.</a></p>
               </details>
               <details>
                  <summary><h4>Single payments</h4></summary>
                  <p>A disability assistance payment (<abbr title="Disability Assistance Payment">DAP</abbr>) is a <strong>single</strong> payment requested by the holder that is paid directly to the beneficiary or to their estate. A <strong>request must be made</strong> <strong>for every <abbr title="Disability Assistance Payment">DAP</abbr> payment.</strong> You must contact your financial organization to request a <abbr title="Disability Assistance Payment">DAP</abbr>.</p>
                  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Each financial organization has different rules around <abbr title="Disability Assistance Payment">DAP</abbr>s. Please contact your financial organization to discuss <abbr title="Disability Assistance Payment">DAP</abbr> options. </p>
               </details>
               <h3>What is included in each payment</h3>
               <p>Payments include <strong>a proportion of each</strong> of the following amounts available for payment:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>contributions (including rollovers, if applicable)</li>
                  <li>grant amounts </li>
                  <li>bond amounts </li>
                  <li>interest earned on investments</li>
               </ul>
               <p> <strong>Note:</strong> Only grant and bond amounts paid into a plan longer than 10 years ago will be included in payments.</p>
               <h3>Only a portion of a  withdrawal will be taxed by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr></h3>
               <p><abbr title="Registered Disability Savings Plan">RDSP</abbr>s are <strong> tax-sheltered</strong> which means you do not pay tax on the money in the plan until it is withdrawn. When you withdraw money from your plan, certain portions of the withdrawal will be taxed:</p>
               <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                  <dt>Taxable amounts</dt>
                  <dd>Grants, bonds, and interest earned on investments will be taxed.</dd>
                  <dt>Non-taxable amounts</dt>
                  <dd>Your original contributions won't be taxed.</dd>
               </dl>
               <h2 id="_Withdrawing_from_RDSP">Withdrawing from your plan may impact provincial benefits</h2>
               <p>In all provinces and territories, opening and contributing to a plan will not affect your other federal or provincial/territorial benefits, such as monthly disability income support payments or monthly pension payments. If you are in one of these provinces, making withdrawals from a plan may impact the amount of provincial benefits you receive:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Quebec</li>
                  <li>New Brunswick</li>
                  <li>Prince Edward Island<strong> </strong></li>
               </ul>
               <p>You should contact your provincial government to know how your other benefits may be impacted.</p>

                     <p><strong>Dan</strong>: The Registered Disability Savings Plan, the RDSP, is a long-term savings plan created by the federal government that helps Canadians with disabilities…</p>
                     <p><strong>Jessie</strong>: … and their families…</p>
                     <p><strong>Dan</strong>: … to prepare for the future. </p>
                     <p>Here are a few things to remember when it’s time to start taking money out of an RDSP. </p>
                     <p>Only the person who manages the RDSP is allowed to take money out of the plan.</p>
                     <p><strong>Jessie</strong>: And all withdrawals must be used only for the beneficiary—the person eligible to receive money from the plan. </p>
                     <p><strong>Dan</strong>: You can take money out at any time, but you can’t wait indefinitely. Withdrawals must begin before December 31… </p>
                     <p><strong>Jessie</strong>: … of the year that the beneficiary turns 60.</p>
                     <p><strong>Dan</strong>: Remember: the plan is for long-term savings. If you take money out when any of the grants and the bonds have been in for less than 10 years, you will have to pay some, or all, of the grant and the bond money back to the Government.</p>
                     <p>For instance, all grants and bonds that have been in the plan for less than 10 years must be paid back to the Government if:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>the plan is closed, or</li>
                        <li>the beneficiary dies</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p><strong>Jessie</strong>: To learn more about the Registered Disability Savings Plan, watch the full series of RDSP online videos. </p>
                     <p><strong>Dan</strong>: For detailed information, such as a list of participating financial institutions or eligibility criteria, visit <a href="/en/employment-social-development/programs/disability/savings/grants-bonds.html">www.esdc.gc.ca/disabilitysavings</a>.</p>
                     <p><strong>Jessie</strong>: Or call 1 800 O-Canada, that’s 1-800-622-6232. </p>
                     <p><strong>Dan</strong>: If you use a teletypewriter, call 1-800-926-9105.</p>
