                             <p>All companies and agencies under the jurisdiction of the Government of Canada are classified as public sector employers. For the purposes of certain statutes, various agencies, such as school boards and hospitals, are considered part of the public sector. They are often referred to as parapublic organizations. Public sector employers can be large or small, though often have numerous employees and are governed by Public Policy mandates.</p>
                             
                             <p>Public sector employers include:</p>
                             <ul>
                                 <li>Public community colleges and vocational schools</li>
                                 <li>Public health, including public hospitals, nursing homes, senior citizen homes, rehabilitation homes</li>
                                 <li>Public degree-granting universities and colleges</li>

                              <p>NOTE: When a public sector employer uses a Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) registered charity business number, it does not change the organization’s designation to a not-for-profit.</p>

                      <p>Clearly describe how your project will help you address the need for skilled trades training equipment and/or materials to meet industry standards or investments in new technology for the apprentices and/or non-registered apprentices in Red Seal trades.</p>
                      <p>Provide information that shows that the training equipment and/or materials will support training for training in Red Seal trades designated by the province and/or territory. A list of Red Seal trades, including the provinces and territories where they are designated, is available on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ellischart.ca/eng/search/s.2.1rch.shtml">Ellis Chart</a>, an online comparative database of apprenticeship programs.</p>
                      <p>Please  indicate how many apprentices and pre-apprentices your project will aim to reach in 2023 to 2024 year of funding. </p>
                      <p>Here are some examples of equipment and/or materials that you can buy:</p>
                      <ul>

                      <p>Training equipment and materials must meet industry standards on the job site. Used equipment is not eligible, but refurbished equipment that aligns with industry standards is eligible.</p>

                        <li>encourage equipment and/or material purchases that support the development of environmental skills in the Red Seal trades. This will support action to address climate change and support Canada’s transition to a lower-carbon economy (see <a href="#h2.03">Glossary</a>);</li>
                        <li>contribute to the CFP objective of reaching approximately 33,000 Red Seal apprentices and pre-apprentices.</li>
