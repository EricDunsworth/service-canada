                        <p>As per section 13.1(a) of the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/funding/canada-summer-jobs/agreement.html">Articles  of Agreement</a>, youth hired for a CSJ-funded job cannot displace or replace existing employees or volunteers, employees that have been laid-off and are awaiting recall, employees absent due to an industrial dispute, employees on vacation, or employees on maternity or parental leave.</p>
                        <p>As per section 20.1,  Nepotism, of the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/funding/canada-summer-jobs/agreement.html">Articles  of Agreement</a>, no cost incurred by the Employer in relation to a Participant who is a member of the Immediate Family of the Employer or who is a member of the Immediate Family of an officer or director of the Employer, is eligible for reimbursement under the Agreement. If Canada is satisfied, and agrees in writing before the commencement of the Job, that the hiring of the Participant was not the result of favouritism by reason of membership in the Immediate Family of the Employer, officer or director, as the case may be, the costs may be eligible for reimbursement.</p>
                        <p>CSJ Program funding cannot be used for self-employment, and the employer must establish an employer-employee relationship with the youth participant (in other words, the youth participant is entered into the organization’s records as an employee, wages are paid which include all necessary payroll deductions in accordance with labour regulations in the province or territory where the employment is located, and as per Section 32 in the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/funding/canada-summer-jobs/agreement.html">Articles of Agreement</a>).</p>
                        <p>As the  intention of the CSJ program is to help youth Canadians successfully transition  into the labour market, <strong>a youth  participant should be employed in only one CSJ-funded job per project</strong>.  Employers are to hire the number of youth identified in their agreement.</p>

                        <summary><h3>Wage contribution </h3></summary>
                        <p>Not-for-profit employers can receive funding for up to 100% of the provincial or territorial adult minimum hourly wage and all associated Mandatory Employment Related Costs (MERCs). Public and private sector employers are eligible to receive funding for up to 50 % of the provincial or territorial minimum hourly wage. Your CSJ funding request may be for less than the minimum wage as long as provincial or territorial legislation permits you to do so. <strong>Public or private sector employers are not eligible for reimbursement of MERCs.</strong></p>
                    <p>To improve the quality of the work placement, employers are encouraged to pay more than the minimum wage and offer a paid position that is longer than the duration of the Agreement; however, reimbursement will only apply to the applicable provincial or territorial adult minimum hourly wage in effect at the time of employment. For example, if a private sector employer pays a youth $17.00 per hour in a province where the minimum hourly wage is $16.00, the contribution provided will be 50% of the minimum wage of $16.00 ($8.00).</p>
                    <p>Some provinces and territories have minimum wage exemptions. If an employer uses an exemption to pay a minimum wage lower than the applicable adult minimum wage, the reimbursement percentage remains the same. For example, as of September 2021, Alberta has an adult minimum wage of $15.00 and a minimum wage exemption for students under 18 years old of $13.00. If a private sector organization uses the lower student wage, the funding contribution will be 50% of the $13.00 minimum wage ($6.50).</p>
                    <p>The following table provides the  adult minimum hourly wage for each  province and territory at the time  this Applicant Guide was  published.</p>
                    <p>It is the employer’s responsibility to confirm the minimum wage at the time of employment. If the minimum wage increases during employment, each week will be reimbursed based on the applicable minimum wage for that week.</p>

                    <p>Employers are required by law to pay:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Health and Post-Secondary Education Tax Levy in Manitoba, and</li>
                        <li>Employer Health Tax in British Columbia and where applicable</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Payroll deductions tables can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/pyrll/t4032/menu-eng.html">CRA</a> website. Check with the appropriate provincial or territorial authorities to ensure that you have the most updated rate information.</p>
                    <p>Not-for-profit employers are eligible for up to 100% reimbursement of MERCs in relation to the minimum hourly wage of the province or territory where the activities take place. <strong>Public or private sector employers are not eligible for reimbursement of MERCs.</strong></p>
                    <h3>Workers’ Compensation Benefits</h3>
                    <p>Youth <strong>must</strong> be covered by Workers’ Compensation or equivalent liability insurance as per Section 29 of the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/funding/canada-summer-jobs/agreement.html">Articles of Agreement</a>. It is your responsibility to verify with your insurer whether your existing equivalent liability insurance (and automobile insurance, if applicable) applies to all the activities to be undertaken by the youth and applies to all the locations where these activities will take place. Not-for-profit employers are eligible to be reimbursed for Workers’ Compensation or Liability Insurance costs as part of their final claim.</p>
                    <h3>Overhead costs - youth with disabilities</h3>
                    <p>Service Canada recognizes that persons with disabilities face additional barriers to entering the workforce. To help them obtain employment, and to encourage employers to hire persons with disabilities, you may be eligible for additional funding to accommodate the youth within the work environment.</p>
                    <p>Eligible overhead costs will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Personal tool adaptations and professional support services (for example, visual language interpreters) to enable the youth to accomplish tasks covered under the agreement may be considered eligible. If you anticipate having these costs, please contact your Project Officer as soon as possible. Note that Service Canada may request an invoice of the overhead cost. Review Section 24.0 of the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/funding/canada-summer-jobs/agreement.html">Articles  of Agreement</a> (Disposition of Assets) for further details, and <a href="/en/employment-social-development/corporate/contact/canada-summer-jobs.html">contact Service Canada</a> for more information. </p>
                    <p>Please note that the <em>Accessible Canada Act</em> defines disability as “any impairment, including a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairment – or a functional limitation – whether permanent, temporary or episodic in nature, or evident or not, that, in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person’s full and equal participation in society”.</p>
                    <h3>Duration and hours of  work </h3>
                    <p>The duration of the CSJ-funded portion of the job must be between 6 and 16 consecutive weeks.</p>
                    <p>Employment of less than the minimum 6 weeks in duration may be deemed ineligible. In this case, any incurred costs would not be reimbursed.</p>
                    <p>Jobs must be full-time (30 to a maximum of 40&nbsp;hours per week). If a youth is provided less than 30&nbsp;hours of work for any week, their wages may be deemed ineligible for reimbursement unless consent has been granted from Service Canada for exceptional circumstances (for example, to accommodate persons with disabilities).</p>
                    <h3>Advances</h3>
                    <p>The conditions for advances are outlined in section 6 of the CSJ <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/funding/canada-summer-jobs/agreement.html">Articles  of Agreement</a>. The maximum advance is 75% of the total value of the agreement for all types of organizations.</p>
