You may request multiple participants for a job title. A job is considered different when at least one of the following details varies: job title, tasks and responsibilities, start date, hourly wage, number of weeks, number of hours per week or preferred level of education of the participant.</p>
                  <p><strong>For online applications:</strong> you will need to state the number of job titles that you are applying for and then how many participants you would like to hire for each job title.</p>
                  <p><strong>For paper applications:</strong> if you are applying for more than three different job titles, you must copy an entire Job Details section for each additional job title and attach it to your application when submitting it. If there is not enough space to appropriately answer a question, you may answer it on a separate sheet and attach it to your application when submitting it.</p>
                  <p>Each youth hired using CSJ funding must be assigned to one of the jobs approved by Service Canada. The details of the job (for example, job title, hourly wage and tasks and responsibilities) must be the same as the job details specified in your application. <strong>Any changes to job details must be submitted to <a href="/en/employment-social-development/corporate/contact/canada-summer-jobs.html">Service Canada</a> for approval. Only exceptional circumstances will be considered.</strong></p>
                  <p>Salaried jobs need to be calculated as an hourly wage rate. If your application is approved, it may not be for all the jobs requested, the full number of weeks requested or the full number of hours requested or the full number of hours requested or full number of hours requested.</p>

                  <p>Enter the job title and hourly wage of each job for which you are requesting funding. CSJ job titles must match options in the National Occupational Classification. This system is the national reference on occupations in Canada. It comprises more than 30,000 occupational titles organized according to skill levels and skill types.</p>
                  <p><strong>For online applications:</strong> the text box uses “predictive text” to help you complete the job title. Begin typing your job title and select the most appropriate option.</p>
                  <p><strong>For paper applications:</strong> please select your job title from one of the options listed on the form. If you select “other”, you must identify a <a href="https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/">National Occupational Classification Code</a> for the proposed job activities. To find the correct code on this webpage, type the proposed job title in the Quick Search box located at the top of the page to generate a list of possible occupations. When reviewing the potential occupations, the accompanying education, main duties and employment requirements should correspond to the job performed.</p>

                  <p>An organization’s CSJ application, if approved by Service Canada, forms part of the agreement between the Government of Canada and the organization. The organization will then be subject to the CSJ <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/funding/canada-summer-jobs/agreement.html">Articles of Agreement</a>. The organization agrees under this agreement to provide the job at the hourly wage, for the number of hours per week and the number of weeks described in the Calculation of Approved Canada Summer Jobs Contribution Amount document. This document will be included in the approval package.</p>
                  <p>The submission of an application does not constitute an agreement. An official agreement between the organization and the Government of Canada exists only once an application is approved and an agreement is signed by Service Canada. It is important that you read the applicant guide and Articles of Agreement in their entirety before you sign the application.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, it is important that only authorized persons’ names are identified on the submitted application. Read Section 37 of the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/funding/canada-summer-jobs/agreement.html">Articles of Agreement</a> prior to signature: “The Employer warrants that its representative(s) identified in this Application/Agreement has (have) the authority to enter into an agreement on its behalf and agrees to provide Canada with such evidence of that authorization as Canada may reasonably require.”</p>
