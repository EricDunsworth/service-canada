    <h3 id="h2.03-h3.01">Reviewing your case<strong> </strong></h3>
    <p>From time to time, cases are reviewed to ensure that only eligible people receive disability benefits.</p>
    <p>If your case is being reviewed, you may be asked to provide current medical and other information. Because everyone's medical condition and capacity to work is unique, each case is looked at individually.</p>
    <p>Once all the necessary information has been collected, a decision to continue or stop disability benefits is made. We will inform you of this decision in writing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h3 id="h2.03-h3.02">Volunteer and educational activities</h3>
  <p>If you are going to school and/or if you are volunteering, you must inform Service Canada if you:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>are doing any of these activities for a combined total of 15 hours a week or more, and</li>
	<li>have been doing these activities on a regular basis for 4 months or longer</li>
</ul>
	<p>School can include college, university, a trade or a technical training program, and can be in person or online.</p>
	<p>The amount of time you spend going to school or training includes the time you spend in all activities related to attending school. These activities can include studying, researching, writing papers, completing assignments and more. </p>
	<p>You must also notify Service Canada if you complete a school, university, trade, technical training or rehabilitation program.</p>
	<p>Service Canada recognizes the importance of volunteer work, education and training. Many of our beneficiaries can participate in volunteer work and education/training and continue to receive their CPP disability benefits.</p>
	<p>However, in some cases this could signal your ability to work and could impact whether you still qualify to receive CPP disability benefits. </p>
	<h4>Examples</h4>
	<details>
	<summary>Volunteering over 15 hours a week for more than 4 months </summary>
	<p> John has been receiving CPP disability pension since November 2015. John has started volunteering as a cashier at a cafeteria and selling clothing. He volunteers 5 days a week, for 5 hours a day since January 2019. His duties include pricing, handling money, cooking and cleaning. </p>
	<p>John needs to report this activity to Service Canada. John’s benefits may be impacted if it is determined his activity demonstrates work capacity.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
	<summary>Combination of volunteering and educational activity totaling over 15 hours a week for more than 4 months </summary>
	<p> Michael has been receiving CPP disability pension since 2015. Six months ago, he started providing free business advice to the business community. He offers his services online for 3 to 4 hours a day, 5 days a week. Sometimes Michael takes mini virtual courses to improve his service offerings.</p>
	<p>Michael needs to report this activity to Service Canada. Michael’s benefits may be impacted if it is determined his activities are demonstrating work capacity.</p>

	<summary>Volunteering under 15 hours a week for more than 4 months </summary>
	<p>Margo has been receiving CPP disability pension since June of 2019. Since then, she sometimes volunteers at a community centre nearby. Her duties included, shredding old documents, photocopying pamphlets and putting them out for display. She spends anywhere from 5 to 10 hours per week at the centre, on a drop in basis whenever she can.</p>
	<p>Margo does not need to report this activity to Service Canada. Although she has participated  in volunteer activity for over 4 months, the activity is under the reporting threshold of 15 hours per week.</p>

    <h3 id="h2.03-h3.03">Working and earning money</h3>
    <p>You  must contact Service Canada when  you begin working, and once you have earned <strong>$6,400</strong> (before tax) in <strong>2022</strong> . Your disability benefits may be  impacted by your gross (before tax) earnings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>if you earn below <strong>$6,400 </strong>(before tax), this alone should not affect your disability  benefits</li>
      <li>if you earn between <strong>$6,400</strong> and <strong>$17,610.06</strong> (before tax), this may show that you are regularly capable of working and it  may affect your disability benefits</li>
      <li>if you earn <strong>$17,610.06</strong> (before tax) or more, this demonstrates you are regularly capable of working  and you will likely no longer qualify for disability benefits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you delay in  contacting us when you start making over the allowed amount, you might have to  pay some money back.</p>
    <p><strong>Vocational  rehabilitation program </strong></p>
    <p> If  you are thinking of returning to work,  a   variety of services such as  guidance, training, and job placement may be available. </p>

    <p><strong>Three-month work trial  </strong></p>
    <p>If  you return to work on a regular basis, you may be able to continue to receive  your disability benefits for 3 months. This gives you and the CPP time to  evaluate your ability to work regularly. </p>
If  you are still capable of working after 3 months, your CPP disability benefits  will likely stop.

      <h4 id="h2.03-h3.03-h4.01">Re-starting disability benefits for the same disability</h4>

    <h2 id="h2.03-h3.04">When your benefit could stop</h2>
    <p>The disability benefit is meant to replace some of your employment income for as long as your disability stops you from working at any job on a regular basis.</p>
    <p>Your disability benefit will stop if you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you are capable of working on a regular basis</li>
      <li>you are no longer disabled</li>
      <li>you turn 65</li>
      <li>you die</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When a disability benefit is cancelled, any related <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-childrens-benefit.html">children's benefits</a> are also cancelled.</p>
    <section>
      <h4 id="h2.03-h3.04-h4.01">When you turn 65</h4>
      <p>When you turn 65 the disability benefit will automatically be changed to a Canada Pension Plan retirement pension. If you are getting the post-retirement disability benefit, it will stop.</p>
      <p>Your retirement pension will be less than your disability benefit. However, you can also apply for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/old-age-security.html">Old Age Security</a> and the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/old-age-security/guaranteed-income-supplement.html">Guaranteed Income Supplement</a>.
