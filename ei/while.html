            	<h3>A mistake on your EI report can affect your claim</h3>
            	<p>A mistake is an unintentional act. We know claimants can make mistakes when filing their reports. </p>
            	<p>Common mistakes include:</p>
            	<ul>
            		<li>estimating weekly earnings instead of putting in the actual amount earned</li>
            		<li>declaring net earnings instead of gross earnings</li>
            		<li>forgetting to declare all the earnings received</li>
            		<li>writing or entering the wrong number when reporting earnings, or</li>
            		<li>adding the number of hours or amount of earnings incorrectly</li>
            	</ul>
            	<p>Some mistakes can delay benefit payments, while others can affect the amount of benefits you receive. This may mean you were paid more or less than you were entitled to receive.</p>
              <details>
            	<summary><h3 class="h4">Impact of incorrectly estimating your earnings</h3></summary>
              <p>Estimating your earnings can have the following effects:</p>
            	<ul class="lst-spcd">
            		<li>if your <strong>estimate for 1 week was higher</strong> than the earnings you actually received
                  <ul><li>your benefit <strong>amount will be less</strong> than it should have been. </li>
                   </li></ul>
            		<li>if your <strong>estimate for 1 week was lower</strong> than the earnings you actually received,

                  <ul><li>your benefit <strong>amount will be higher</strong> than it should have been. You’ll have to repay the excess amount, but we’ll ensure that repaying it causes no undue hardship.</li>
                    </li></ul>
            	</ul>

              <p>If this happens, let us know and we’ll adjust your file to make sure you receive all the benefits you’re entitled to. </ul>

              <p>When you work and receive benefits at the same time, you must <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/employment-insurance-reporting.html">report</a> your work earnings and hours for each week you work, in the week in which the work occurred.</p>
              <p>If you receive other payments while receiving <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr>, some <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/various-types-earnings.html">types of earnings</a> will be deducted from your <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> benefits. Other types of income have no impact on your <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> benefits. You can refer to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/earnings-chart.html">earnings chart</a> to find out if a payment is considered earnings for benefit purposes and, if so, how those earnings are allocated.</p>
              <p><strong>Earning money impacts your benefit amount</strong></p>

                <p>If you work while receiving regular benefits and have served your waiting period:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>you'll be able to keep 50 cents of your Employment Insurance (EI)  benefits for every dollar you earn, up to 90% of the weekly insurable earnings used to calculate your <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> benefit amount. </li>

                <li>if you earn any money above this 90%, we'll deduct it dollar for dollar from your benefits.</li>

            	<p>You’re not usually eligible to receive regular benefits while you’re away from Canada. However, you may receive regular benefits if you show that you’re available for work in Canada while abroad.</p>
              <p>The amount of time that you can be abroad depends on why you're travelling:</p>

                <h4>You must continue your job search and EI reporting while outside of Canada</h4>
                <p>If you indicate that you’ve taken measures to be reached if an employment opportunity presents itself during your absence and that you’re able to return to Canada within 48 hours, we’ll accept that you’ve proven your availability.</p>
                <p>You <strong>must notify us of your travel</strong> on <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">My Service Canada Account (MSCA)</a> or through your bi-weekly report.</p>
                <h5>We will confirm your reason for travel by working with border security</h5>

                 <p>If we find you’ve been out of the country while collecting benefits, we’ll determine whether you were entitled to receive those benefits. If you weren’t entitled to receive them, we’ll calculate how much we overpaid you, and you’ll then have to repay the benefits.</p>
                <p><strong>You may have to repay benefits if you were overpaid while outside of Canada</strong></p>
              	<p>We may also impose penalties of up to 3 times your weekly benefit rate or 3 times the amount of your overpayment. As well, you may have to work more hours or, in the case of fishing benefits, you may need more insurable earnings to qualify for benefits in the future.</p>

In that case, the form  <a href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=INS3280">Appointment of Representative</a> must be completed and returned with your <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> application.</p>

            		<li>you request a termination of your claim to file a new claim </li>
            	</ul>
            	<p>If you start working before you finish your  current <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> claim, you must  tell us when you complete your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/employment-insurance-reporting.html"><abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> report</a>. This will allow us to  adjust or stop your claim, depending on whether the work is full-time, part-time or by contract. If the work is short-term or a contract, you may re-activate your <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> claim and  continue to receive your biweekly payments when you’re laid off.</p>

            	<h2 id="h2.05">You can receive different types of benefits one after the other</h2>
            	<p>You can normally receive up to 50 weeks of benefits when regular benefits are combined with maternity, parental, sickness or caregiving benefits in the same benefit period (of 52 weeks).</p>
              <details>
                <summary>EI Regular benefits and extended parental benefits in a 52-week period</summary>
            	<p>The only exception is when <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> regular benefits and extended parental benefits are paid during the 52-week period. As extended parental benefits are paid at a benefit rate of 33% of your average weekly insurable earnings, once 50 weeks of benefits have been paid, the weeks of extended parental benefits will be converted to an equivalent number of weeks that would have been paid at the 55% benefit rate. </p>

                <p>This conversion will determine how many more weeks of regular benefits and special benefits can be paid to reach the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at the 55% benefits rate. Any weeks where you return to work during this period will be considered weeks paid for the purposes of calculating the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at the 55% benefit rate. Once the number of additional weeks that can be paid is determined, the 52-week benefit period will be extended to allow for the additional weeks to be paid.</p>
            	<p>It's important to note that you can’t receive more than 1 type of benefit at the same time.</p>

            	<h2 id="h2.06">Situations where you may owe money</h2>
            	<p>Deductions can never be taken for money owed directly to a person or company. However, deductions can be taken from your <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> benefits to repay money you owe, <strong>if</strong>:</p>
            	<ul>
            		<li>you received an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/overpayments.html">overpayment from <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr></a></li>
            		<li>you received an advance or assistance from the Government of Canada or any of its agencies, a provincial or municipal government, or any other authority <strong>and</strong> an arrangement has been taken with <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> for the deduction. Your consent must be given in writing to the deduction and payment by <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr>. Example: you received an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/reports/social-assistance.html">advance from a Social Services agency</a> while waiting for your <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> benefits to start</li>
            		<li>the Department of Justice issued a court order, according to the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-1.4/">Family Orders and Agreements (FOA) Enforcement Assistance Act</a>. Your <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> benefits are garnished and forwarded to the Department of Justice that ensures payment to your spouse / dependents, according to the existing court order</li>
            		<li>the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may collect taxes owing according to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/">Income Tax Act</a>, the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-14/">Excise Tax Act</a> or other provisions enforced by the CRA.

            	<h3>If you receive more than you're entitled to, you’ll have a debt to repay</h3>
            	<p>When <abbr title="Employment Insurance">EI</abbr> claimants receive benefits to which they are not entitled, the amount of the overpayment counts as a debt that must be repaid.</p>
            	<p>We charge interest on this debt when it results from claimants who knowingly:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>withhold information, or </li>
                <li>make false or misleading representations or statements.</li>
              </ul>
            	<p>The rate of interest is the Bank of Canada average rate plus 3%. Interest is calculated daily and compounded monthly.</p>
              <p>We do not charge interest on debt that results when we make an error in the benefit payment.</p>
