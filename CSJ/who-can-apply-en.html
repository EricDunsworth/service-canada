  <h3>Costs eligible for reimbursement</h3>
  <h4>Wage contribution</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Not-for-profit employers:</strong> can receive funding for up to 100% of the provincial or territorial adult minimum hourly wage and all associated Mandatory Employment Related Costs (MERCs). </li>
  <li><strong>Public and private sector employers:</strong> are eligible to receive funding for up to 50 % of the provincial or territorial minimum hourly wage. Your CSJ funding request may be for less than the minimum wage as long as provincial or territorial legislation permits you to do so. </li>
</ul>
<p>Public or private sector employers are not eligible for reimbursement of MERCs.</p>
<h5>Reimbursement applies to the adult minimum hourly wage</h5>
  <p>To improve the quality of the work placement, employers are encouraged to pay more than the minimum wage and offer a paid position that is longer than the duration of the Agreement. However, reimbursement will only apply to the applicable provincial or territorial adult minimum hourly wage in effect at the time of employment.</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
     <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <p>If a private sector employer pays a youth $17.00 per hour in a province where the minimum hourly wage is $16.00, the contribution provided will be 50% of the minimum wage of $16.00 ($8.00).</p>
     </details>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h5>Reimbursement percentage is the same even if you use an exemption to pay lower than minimum wage</h5>
  <p>Some provinces and territories have minimum wage exemptions. If an employer uses an exemption to pay a minimum wage lower than the applicable adult minimum wage, the reimbursement percentage remains the same.</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
     <details>
      <summary>Example</summary>
      <p>As of September 2021, Alberta has an adult minimum wage of $15.00 and a minimum wage exemption for students under 18 years old of $13.00. If a private sector organization uses the lower student wage, the funding contribution will be 50% of the $13.00 minimum wage ($6.50).</p>
     </details>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h5>Adult minimum hourly wage for each province and territory</h5>
  <p>The following table provides the adult minimum hourly wage for each province and territory at the time this Applicant Guide was published.</p>
  <p>It is the employer’s responsibility to confirm the minimum wage at the time of employment. If the minimum wage increases during employment, each week will be reimbursed based on the applicable minimum wage for that week.</p>

  <p>Youth <strong>must</strong> be covered by Workers’ Compensation or equivalent liability insurance as per Section 29 of the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/funding/canada-summer-jobs/agreement.html">Articles of Agreement</a>. It is your responsibility to verify with your insurer whether your existing equivalent liability insurance (and automobile insurance, if applicable) applies to all the activities to be undertaken by the youth and applies to all the locations where these activities will take place. Not-for-profit employers are eligible to be reimbursed for Workers’ Compensation or Liability Insurance costs as part of their final claim.</p>
  <h3>Overhead costs - youth with disabilities</h3>
  <p>You may be eligible for additional funding to hire and accommodate the youth with disabilities within the work environment.</p>

  <p>If you anticipate having these costs, please contact your Project Officer as soon as possible. Service Canada may request an invoice of the overhead cost.

      <summary>What is a disability?</summary>
      <p>The <em>Accessible Canada Act</em> defines disability as “any impairment, including a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairment – or a functional limitation – whether permanent, temporary or episodic in nature, or evident or not, that, in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person’s full and equal participation in society”.</p>

  <h4>Must be between 6 and 16 consecutive weeks</h4>

   <h4>Jobs must be 30 to 40 hours per week</h4>
  <p>Jobs must be full-time (30 to a maximum of 40 hours per week). If a youth is provided less than 30 hours of work for any week, their wages may be deemed ineligible for reimbursement unless consent has been granted from Service Canada for exceptional circumstances (for example, to accommodate persons with disabilities).</p>

  <h3>Advances</h3>
  <p>The conditions for advances are outlined in section 6 of the CSJ <a href="/en/employment-social-development/services/funding/canada-summer-jobs/agreement.html">Articles  of Agreement</a>. The maximum advance is 75% of the total value of the agreement for all types of organizations.</p>

      <summary>Example #1 -  Youth with disabilities</summary>
      <p>A not-for-profit organization that runs a summer camp, seeks to hire youth with disabilities as camp counselors.</p>
      <p>The counselors will plan and lead daily activities for campers and provide various supports to campers based on the individual needs of the youth. The counselors will be under the direct supervision of senior camp leaders on a daily basis. Supervision will include comprehensive health and safety training in advance of the camp session, as well as regular daily meetings to discuss concerns or issues. Each youth hired will also receive one-on-one mentoring throughout the summer.</p>
      <p>A project like this would receive additional assessment points as it responds to one of the program’s national priorities.

      <summary>Example #3 - Indigenous youth</summary>
      <p>An Indigenous-led organization seeks to hire Indigenous youth to support services to community members and to assist with Indigenous cultural awareness events taking place throughout the summer. To support these events, youth will assist with guided tours, storytelling, traditional dance performances and craft workshops. At the local office, youth will assist community members with resumé building. Youth will also work to connect Elders with children in the community so that children can learn about their culture and heritage. Outcomes for youth include experience in client service and community development and development of leadership, communication and teamwork skills.</p>

      <summary>Example #4 - Small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that self-report as having leadership from groups that are underrepresented in the labour market</summary>
      <p>A local restaurant owned by an individual who self-reports as being from an underrepresented group plans to hire youth to assist with processing and delivering orders over the summer months.</p>
      <p>The youth will work in small teams to plan and conduct deliveries. They will also be responsible for keeping accurate records. The youth will receive in-person training throughout their first week from their supervisor and then a senior staff member will be assigned as their mentor for the remainder of the placement. Included in the youth’s training will be direction for client service and the proper procedures for social distancing in a professional setting. Outcomes for the youth will be learning how to develop work plans as a team as well as gaining experience in client service through coordinating delivery drop-offs.</p>
