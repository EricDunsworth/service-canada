This is a repository used by Service Canada to prototype and test ideas.

##How to use the templates

1) Select one of the templates in the template folder:
- basic: basic layout
- subway-landing: index page for the subway pattern
- subway-section: page with the subway navigation on the right


2) Duplicate the template in the right folder - or copy the code from the template in a new file in the right folder

3) Modify the title tag and the breadcrumb trail, if applicable

4) Locate the section that has this comment: "CONTENT STARTS HERE"

5) Start editing the content - you can copy paste patterns from the basic template, or copy-paste code from other Canada.ca pages

6) Besides the title and breadcrumb trail, only edit code that's between CONTENT STARTS HERE and CONTENT ENDS HERE.
